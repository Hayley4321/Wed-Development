    <h1 class="underline">Introduction To HTML</h1>
    <p>
        HTML <strong>(<span class="bold underline">H</span>yper<span class="bold underline">T</span>ext <span class="bold underline">M</span>arkup <span class="bold underline">L</span>anguage)</strong> is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

        HTML was invented by physicist Tim Berners-Lee. Its first version was published was in 1993.

    <h2 class="underline">So What Is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
        HTML is a <span class="bold">markup language</span> that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of <em>elements</em>, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:

    alt="Anatomy of an HTML element"
    width="550"
    />
    <p>
        The main parts of an HTML element are as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
         <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing <strong>angle brackets</strong>. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
        </li>
        <li>OTHERS</li>
    </ol>
